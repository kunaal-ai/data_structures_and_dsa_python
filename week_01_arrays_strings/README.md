# Week 1: Arrays, Strings & Analysis

## 📌 Focus Areas
- Two-Pointer Technique
- Sliding Window Pattern
- Prefix Sums
- In-place Operations
- Time/Space Complexity Analysis

## 📚 Key Concepts
1. **Two-Pointer Technique**
   - When to use: When you need to process elements in a sequence with two pointers
   - Common patterns: Pair sum, removing duplicates, in-place operations

2. **Sliding Window**
   - When to use: Subarray/substring problems with fixed or dynamic window size
   - Common patterns: Maximum sum subarray, longest substring with K distinct characters

3. **Prefix Sums**
   - When to use: Range sum queries, subarray sum problems
   - Common patterns: Contiguous subarray sum, equilibrium index

4. **In-place Operations**
   - When to use: When O(1) space is required
   - Common patterns: Array deduplication, move zeros, in-place reversal

## 🎯 Practice Goals
- 15 problems focusing on pattern recognition
- Master time/space complexity analysis
- Develop intuition for when to use each pattern

## 📝 Notes
- Always analyze time and space complexity
- Draw examples before coding
- Consider edge cases (empty array, single element, etc.)
- Practice drawing diagrams for visualization
